        Suck It and See is the fourth studio album by English rock band Arctic
        Monkeys, released on 6 June 2011 by Domino Recording Company. Musically,
        Suck It and See represents a departure for the band following the darker
        sound of its predecessor Humbug (2009), the album features a wide
        variety of styles, from guitar pop to psychedelic pop. The album's
        title, a British phrase meaning "give it a try", was viewed as
        provocative in the United States.<br></br>

        Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino is the sixth studio album by English
        rock band Arctic Monkeys, released on 11 May 2018 by Domino Recording
        Company. It was written by band frontman Alex Turner in 2016 on a
        Steinway Vertegrand piano in his Los Angeles home. The album features a
        rich sound that embodies psychedelic pop, lounge pop, space pop, and
        glam rock, as well as elements of jazz. It is a major departure from the
        band's previous guitar-heavy work, being less accessible than its
        internationally successful predecessor
